## Summary of Insights
### Pizza Size
- The majority of our pizza sales are attributed to Small, Medium, and Large sizes, each accounting for approximately 30% of total sales. Among these sizes, Large pizzas are the most popular, making up 38% of all pizzas sold.
- In contrast, XL and XXL pizzas have lower sales, with XL sizes comprising only 1.11% and XXL sizes representing a mere 0.006% of total pizzas sold. Interestingly, there are months where no XXL pizzas were sold at all.
  
### Daily Sale Trend
- The daily sales trend remains relatively steady throughout the year. Notably, the top 5 selling days occurred on May 15, July 14, October 15, November 16, and November 27. 

### Categories and Individual Pizzas Sold
- None of the four categories significantly dominate sales. The Classic category leads in sales with 30%, while Chicken falls behind with 22% of sales.
- Among the top 6 individual pizzas sold, three belong to the Chicken category and three to the Classic category. Despite being the second most popular category overall, the Supreme category has 4 out of the bottom 5 individual pizzas sold.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- Since XL and XXL pizzas account for only 1.17% of total sales, it's crucial to explore strategies to increase their popularity. Consider introducing combos, sales, or promotions to boost sales for these sizes.
- Four of the top five selling days occurred in the second half of the year. Are there ways that we can get more days of high sales in the first half of the year?
- Despite having three of the top six selling pizzas, the Chicken category has the smallest proportion of sales and only has six pizzas available. Adding more Chicken pizza options might enhance overall sales, considering their popularity. Replacing the underperforming Brie Carre or other Supreme pizzas with new Chicken options could be beneficial.
